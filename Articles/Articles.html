<h2><strong> Article 1: Meet Bella, Our Star Reader </strong></h2>
<p> Bella, a 3-year-old golden retriever, is one of our most successful literacy students. When she joined the program, Bella struggled to understand basic phonics. Thanks to her dedicated tutor, she now wags her tail with pride while reading <em> Go, Dog, Go!</em> aloud to her puppies. </p>
<p> Bella's owner shares, "I used to think she was barking for treats, but now I know she's practicing consonant blends. It's incredible!" </p>

<h2><strong> Article 2: How Literacy Transforms Lives </strong></h2> 
<p> Literacy changes everything for dogs. Shelter dogs with basic reading skills are twice as likely to be adopted. Family pets who can read labels avoid dangerous foods. And senior dogs who read stay mentally sharp longer. </p>
<p> Studies show that canine literacy programs reduce stress and improve overall well-being, for both dogs and their owners. At <em>Paws for Literacy</em>, weâ€™re proud to be leading the charge in this transformative work. </p>
