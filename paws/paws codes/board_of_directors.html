<p> Dr. Sniffington has spent her career in canine education, pioneering research on phonics for puppies. She joined Paws for Literacy after realizing her dachshund, Theodore, couldn't read road signs. Rebecca's passion for literacy is matched only by her love of baking organic treats for her dog. </p>

<h3> Mr. Charles "Chuck" Fetcher </h3>
<h4> Treasurer </h4>

<p>Chuck comes from a financial background, managing budgets for nonprofits across the globe. A lifelong dog lover, he is dedicated to ensuring every dollar raised goes toward books and learning materials for dogs in need. Fun fact: Chuck's German Shepherd, Bark Twain, is fluent in 12 commands. </p>

<h3> Susan Abernathy </h3>
<h4> Director of Operations, Paws for Literacy </h4>
<img src="images/board/SusanAbernathy.png" width = 25%>
<p> Susan Abernathy has been the heart and soul of Paws for Literacy since its inception in 2015. With a background in nonprofit management and a lifelong passion for animal welfare, Susan brings unparalleled dedication to her role. From herding volunteers to coordinating literacy initiatives, she ensures every aspect of the organization runs smoothly and effectively.</p>
<p>Susan's journey with Paws for Literacy began when she realized the startling lack of educational resources available to dogs in her community. What started as a small book drive quickly blossomed into a nationwide movement under her leadership. Known for her tenacity and humor, Susan juggles everything from donor relations to organizing phonics workshops for four-legged learners.</p>
<p>When she's not advocating for canine literacy, Susan enjoys baking homemade dog treats and reading mystery novels-sometimes aloud to her own rescue mutt, Daisy, who is an enthusiastic listener but still struggles with consonant blends.</p>
<p>Her favorite part of the job? Watching the transformation in dogs who find their voice (or bark) through reading. "Every wagging tail is a success story," she says. </p>
